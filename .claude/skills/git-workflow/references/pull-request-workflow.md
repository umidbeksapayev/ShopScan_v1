# Pull Request Workflow

## PR Best Practices

### Size Guidelines

| Size | Lines Changed | Review Time | Defect Risk |
|------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| XS | 0-10 | < 5 min | Very Low |
| S | 11-100 | 15-30 min | Low |
| M | 101-400 | 30-60 min | Medium |
| L | 401-1000 | 1-2 hours | High |
| XL | 1000+ | Multiple sessions | Very High |

**Target**: Keep PRs under 400 lines when possible.

   - Readability and maintainability
   - Adherence to coding standards
   - Appropriate error handling

2. **Functionality**
   - Logic correctness
   - Edge cases handled
   - Requirements met

3. **Testing**
   - Test coverage adequate
   - Tests meaningful and correct
   - Edge cases tested

4. **Security**
   - No obvious vulnerabilities
   - Sensitive data handling
   - Input validation

5. **Performance**

### Review Comments

```markdown
# Levels of feedback

# 🔴 Blocking - Must be addressed
This introduces a security vulnerability. User input is not sanitized
before being used in the SQL query.

# 🟡 Suggestion - Should consider
Consider extracting this logic into a separate function for reusability
and testing.

# 🟢 Nit - Minor issue
Nit: This variable name could be more descriptive.
`data` → `userProfileData`

# 💡 Question - Seeking understanding
Question: What's the reasoning behind using a Map here instead of an Object?

# 👍 Praise - Positive feedback
Nice catch handling the edge case where the array might be empty!
```

## Atomic Commits (Default — No Squash Unless Asked)

**The project default is atomic commits preserved end-to-end.** Squash is destructive: it loses GPG signatures, collapses bisection granularity, and destroys narrative. Never squash unless the user asks for it in this task.

### What "atomic" means

- One commit = one self-contained logical change
- Each commit builds and passes tests independently
- No "WIP", "fixup", or "oops" commits in final history — rebase them away before merge
- Mixed changes get split (`git add -p`, `git commit --fixup`, `git rebase --autosquash`)

### Preferred merge strategies (in order)

1. **Rebase + merge commit** (`gh pr merge --merge` after `git rebase origin/main`): linear feature history with an explicit merge point. Preserves signatures. This is the default for Netresearch repos.
2. **Fast-forward merge** (local `git merge --ff-only`): when signed commits are required AND only rebase is allowed (see "Signed Commits with Rebase Merge" below).
3. **Squash**: only when the user explicitly asks.

### If you catch yourself typing `--squash`

Stop. Re-read the task. Did the user say "squash"? If not, use `--merge` or `--rebase` (with the signed-commits caveat). The correction "no squash! atomic commits!" is a repeat interruption — prevent it by defaulting to merge-commit.

## Review Thread Resolution (SHA Citation Required)

**Never reply with "Addressed" or "Fixed" without citing the resolving commit SHA.** Review threads are resolved on GitHub's side, not by agent assertion.

### Correct reply pattern

```bash
# After pushing the fix
SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($body: String!, $id: ID!) {
    addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {body: $body, pullRequestReviewThreadId: $id}) {
      comment { id }
    }
  }' \
  -f body="Fixed in ${SHA:0:7} — <1-sentence explanation of what changed and why>." \
  -f id="PRRT_xxx"

# Then resolve the thread
gh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "PRRT_xxx"}) { thread { isResolved } } }'
```

### Refusing the lazy pattern

These replies are banned:
- `Addressed` (no SHA, no explanation)
- `Fixed — merged` (merged what? where?)
- `Done` (done how?)
- `Good point, updated` (updated what, in which commit?)

Every resolving reply must include: commit SHA (7+ chars), one sentence of what changed, one sentence of why if not obvious from the diff.

### Verifying AI-reviewer claims before acting

AI reviewers (GitHub Copilot, Gemini Code Assist, SonarCloud) mix correct findings with confident hallucinations. Before applying **or** declining a review comment, verify its load-bearing factual claim against an authoritative source — the framework/library code, official docs, or a quick local probe — not the reviewer's assertion alone.

- **Applying blindly** ships wrong code (e.g. an edit based on a false API claim, which may also fail your own linter/type-checker).
- **Declining blindly** dismisses real bugs — the same reviewer is often right about the next comment.

Reply citing the evidence either way. When you applied a change, the reply must still carry the commit SHA and the what/why required above (e.g. `Verified against <source>: <fact> — applied in <SHA>, which …`); when you declined, state the source and fact (e.g. `Verified against <source>: <fact> — declining.`). When the suggestion is a code change, run the project's checks (lint, types, tests) on it before resolving, so the reply cites a green result rather than a guess.

### Verifying thread state from GitHub, not memory

Before declaring a PR review-complete, re-fetch thread state from GitHub. Never trust your own belief about what you resolved:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!) {
    repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
      pullRequest(number: $pr) {
        reviewThreads(first: 100) {
          nodes { id isResolved comments(first: 1) { nodes { body author { login } } } }
        }
      }
    }
  }' -f owner=OWNER -f repo=REPO -F pr=NUMBER \
  | jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved == false) | {id, first_comment: .comments.nodes[0].body[:80]}'
```

If that returns any rows, the PR is not merge-ready.

## Merge Strategies

### Merge Commit

```bash
# Creates a merge commit, preserves all history
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff feature/my-feature

# Result:
#   * Merge branch 'feature/my-feature'
#   |\
#   | * feat: add feature part 2
#   | * feat: add feature part 1
#   |/
#   * Previous main commit
```

**Use when:**
- Want to preserve complete branch history
- Complex features with meaningful intermediate commits
- Audit trail required

### Squash and Merge

```bash
# Combines all commits into one
git checkout main
git merge --squash feature/my-feature
git commit -m "feat: complete feature implementation"

# Result:
#   * feat: complete feature implementation
#   * Previous main commit
```

**Use when:**
- Feature branch has messy history
- WIP commits, fixups, "oops" commits
- Want clean linear history

### Rebase and Merge

```bash
# Replays commits on top of main
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase main
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only feature/my-feature

# Result:
#   * feat: add feature part 2
#   * feat: add feature part 1
#   * Previous main commit
```

**Use when:**
- Clean commit history in feature branch
- Each commit is meaningful and tested
- Want linear history without merge commits

### Comparison

| Strategy | History | Complexity | Traceability |
|----------|---------|------------|--------------|
| Merge | Preserved | High | High |
| Squash | Combined | Low | Medium |
| Rebase | Linear | Low | Medium |

## Automated Checks

### GitHub Actions for PRs

## PR Lifecycle

### States

```
Draft → Ready for Review → Changes Requested → Approved → Merged
         ↑_____________________|
```

### Commands

```bash
# Check PR status
gh pr status
gh pr view 123

# Request review
gh pr edit 123 --add-reviewer "@reviewer1,@reviewer2"

# Mark ready for review
gh pr ready 123

# Convert to draft
gh pr ready 123 --undo

# Approve PR
gh pr review 123 --approve

# Request changes
gh pr review 123 --request-changes --body "Please fix X"

# Merge PR
gh pr merge 123 --squash --delete-branch

# Close without merging
gh pr close 123
```

### Handling Stale PRs

```yaml
# .github/workflows/stale.yml
name: Mark Stale PRs

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily

jobs:
  stale:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/stale@v9
        with:
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          stale-pr-message: 'This PR has been inactive for 14 days. Please update or close.'
          days-before-stale: 14
          days-before-close: 7
          stale-pr-label: 'stale'
```

## Conflict Resolution

### Before Merging

```bash
# Update feature branch with latest main
git checkout feature/my-feature
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# If conflicts occur
# 1. Edit conflicting files
# 2. Stage resolved files
git add <resolved-file>
# 3. Continue rebase
git rebase --continue

# Force push (only on feature branches!)
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Merge Conflicts in PR

```bash
# Option 1: Rebase (preferred for clean history)
git checkout feature/my-feature
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
# Resolve conflicts
git push --force-with-lease

# Option 2: Merge main into feature
git checkout feature/my-feature
git merge origin/main
# Resolve conflicts
git commit
git push
```

### `--force-with-lease` Rejected with "stale info"

On PRs that bots touch (auto-approve, Renovate/Dependabot, a CI step that pushes), `git push --force-with-lease` can be rejected with `stale info` even when your local work is correct: a bot updated the remote branch since your last fetch, so the lease's expected ref (your `origin/<branch>` tracking ref) no longer matches and the push aborts. This is the safety check working — don't escalate to plain `--force`.

Fetch, see what arrived, then push — the lease now matches the ref you just fetched:

```bash
BR=feature/my-feature
git fetch origin "$BR"
git log HEAD..origin/"$BR"               # what the bot pushed — safe to discard?
git push --force-with-lease origin "$BR" # lease compares against the fetched tracking ref
```

If a bot keeps pushing inside the fetch→push window so the plain lease never matches, pin it to the head you just inspected. This pins, not skips, the check — it accepts exactly that SHA, so only run it right after the `git log` above confirms those commits are safe to discard:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease="$BR:$(git rev-parse origin/"$BR")" origin "$BR"
```

### Complex Conflicts

```bash
# Use a merge tool
git mergetool

# Or use specific tool
git mergetool --tool=vscode
git mergetool --tool=meld

# Configure default tool
git config --global merge.tool vscode
git config --global mergetool.vscode.cmd 'code --wait $MERGED'
```

## PR Analytics

### Metrics to Track

1. **PR Size**: Average lines changed
2. **Review Time**: Time from creation to first review
3. **Time to Merge**: Creation to merge
4. **Review Rounds**: Number of change requests
5. **Throughput**: PRs merged per week

### GitHub Insights

```bash
# List PR stats
gh pr list --state merged --json number,title,createdAt,mergedAt,additions,deletions

# PR age analysis
gh pr list --state open --json number,createdAt | jq 'map({number, age: (now - (.createdAt | fromdateiso8601)) / 86400})'
```

## Review Thread Management

### Replying to Review Threads

When addressing review feedback, reply directly to the thread (not a new comment):

```bash
# Find the thread ID for a comment
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments \
  --jq '.[] | {id, node_id, body}'

# Reply to a review thread via GraphQL
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($body: String!, $threadId: ID!) {
    addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {
      body: $body,
      pullRequestReviewThreadId: $threadId
    }) {
      comment { id }
    }
  }' \
  -f body="Fixed in commit abc123" \
  -f threadId="PRRT_xxxxx"
```

### Resolving Review Threads

After addressing feedback and pushing fixes:

```bash
# Resolve a review thread
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($threadId: ID!) {
    resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $threadId}) {
      thread { isResolved }
    }
  }' \
  -f threadId="PRRT_xxxxx"

# List unresolved threads
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!) {
    repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
      pullRequest(number: $pr) {
        reviewThreads(first: 50) {
          nodes {
            id
            isResolved
            comments(first: 1) {
              nodes { body }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }' -f owner=OWNER -f repo=REPO -F pr=NUMBER
```

## Diagnosing CI Failures (Annotations First)

> Failure first-step, not pre-merge gate. The Merge Gate below uses `annotations_count` as a *warnings present?* signal after success. This section is the inverse: when a workflow has *failed* and you don't yet know why, read the annotation text **first**, before any other diagnostic action.

### Anti-pattern

When a GitHub Actions run fails — especially with `startup_failure`, "no jobs ran", "config invalid", or any failure where the PR summary view shows just a red X with no detail — do **not**:

- Speculate about transient infra issues
- Blame upstream commits or reusable-workflow regressions
- Diff the workflow YAML against the last known good revision
- Re-run the workflow hoping it passes

…before reading the check-runs annotations. The literal validator error is almost always sitting there in one line. Annotations are **invisible in the PR summary view** — they're only rendered in the Actions UI under each job's "Annotations" panel, easy to miss.

### Recipe

```bash
SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)  # or the failing commit SHA

# 1. Find every check run on that commit that has annotations
#    {owner}/{repo} are gh api placeholders — auto-resolved from cwd or $GH_REPO
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/$SHA/check-runs" --paginate \
  --jq '.check_runs[] | select(.output?.annotations_count? // 0 > 0) | "\(.id)\t\(.name)"' |
while IFS=$'\t' read -r run_id name; do
  echo "=== $name ==="
  # 2. Print the annotation text (level, file, line, message).
  #    --paginate guards against runs with > 100 annotations (rare for startup
  #    failures, common for linters like reviewdog).
  gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/check-runs/$run_id/annotations" --paginate \
    --jq '.[] | "[\(.annotation_level)] \(.path):\(.start_line) \(.message)"'
  echo ""
done
```

Drop this into the troubleshooting flow as **step 0**. If the annotations are empty, *then* fall back to logs (`gh run view RUN_ID --log-failed`) and YAML diffs.

### Real-world example

A reusable-workflow caller failed with `startup_failure` and zero jobs. Multiple turns were spent blaming upstream `netresearch/typo3-ci-workflows@main` commits and even pinning to a known-good SHA as a workaround. The annotation said the actual cause in one line:

> Error calling workflow '...'. The nested job 'preflight' is requesting 'actions: read', but is only allowed 'actions: none'.

Fix: one-line `actions: read` add to the caller's `permissions:` block ([t3x-nr-passkeys-be@0533835](https://github.com/netresearch/t3x-nr-passkeys-be/commit/0533835)). Reading the annotations first would have collapsed a 6-step diagnostic loop into a 2-step fix.

### Relationship to the Merge Gate annotations check

| Stage | Question | Endpoint |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Failure diagnosis (this section) | "Why did the run fail?" | `/check-runs/{id}/annotations` (read messages) |
| Pre-merge gate (below) | "Are there warnings to clear before merging green CI?" | `/commits/{sha}/check-runs` (count > 0) |

Same endpoint family, different question — read the annotation text on failure, count it on success.

## Merge Gate

Before merging any PR, run this gate. If any check fails, stop and fix the underlying issue rather than overriding.

### Pre-Merge Checklist

- [ ] **All review threads resolved** — no unresolved conversations
- [ ] **Copilot review complete** (if assigned) — wait for automated review
- [ ] **Branch rebased on target** — no stray merge commits in PR branch
- [ ] **All CI checks pass** — green status on every required check
- [ ] **No CI annotations** — check job annotations, not just pass/fail (see below)
- [ ] **Signed commits** — every commit in the PR is signed

### Merge-Gate Command

```bash
# Primary gate — single gh pr view that returns every PR-level input.
# --json takes a comma-separated field list with no spaces, so keep the
# whole list on one line.
gh pr view NUMBER --json reviewDecision,mergeStateStatus,mergeable,statusCheckRollup,reviewThreads

# Merge-ready requires ALL of:
#   reviewDecision                            == "APPROVED"
#   mergeStateStatus                          == "CLEAN"
#   mergeable                                 == "MERGEABLE"
#   every statusCheckRollup[].conclusion      == "SUCCESS"
#   every reviewThreads[].isResolved          == true   # gh flattens the GraphQL edges/nodes
```

The PR-level gate above covers review decision, merge state, required checks, and thread resolution in one response. A second check is needed for CI annotations (warnings — reviewdog / actionlint / CodeQL deprecations — that don't fail their check but still need addressing). These are a commit-level property, not a PR-level one:

```bash
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/SHA/check-runs" \
  --jq '.check_runs[] | select(.output.annotations_count > 0) | {name: .name, annotations: .output.annotations_count}'
```

> **Important:** CI annotations are invisible in the PR summary view but visible in the job detail "Annotations" section on the Files Changed tab. Always check for annotations before declaring a PR clean.

For automated enforcement at tool-invocation time, see the `merge-gate.sh` hook recipe in `references/claude-code-hooks.md`. The hook enforces the **runtime-checkable subset** — `reviewDecision`, `mergeStateStatus`, and unresolved thread count — which covers the most common block reasons. Signed-commits and CI-annotations checks are not enforced by the hook (annotations in particular require the commit-level API call above); rely on the repo's branch-protection rules and local pre-commit hook for those.

> **Important:** CI checks can PASS while emitting warning annotations (e.g., actionlint/shellcheck via reviewdog, CodeQL deprecation notices). These are invisible in the PR summary view but visible in the job detail "Annotations" section. Always check for annotations before declaring a PR clean.

## Signed Commits with Rebase Merge

### The Problem

When a repository requires:
1. Signed commits AND
2. Only rebase merge (no merge commits, no squash)

GitHub **cannot** sign rebased commits automatically:

```bash
gh pr merge 123 --rebase
# Error: Base branch requires signed commits.
# Rebase merges cannot be automatically signed by GitHub.
```

### The Solution: Local Fast-Forward Merge

Since commits are already signed locally, merge locally and push:

```bash
# 1. Ensure local main is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Verify feature branch is rebased (should be fast-forward)
git log --oneline main..feature-branch

# 3. Fast-forward merge (preserves original signatures)
git merge feature-branch --ff-only

# 4. Push to main
git push origin main

# 5. Close the PR (it will auto-close if commits match)
# Or manually: gh pr close NUMBER
```

### Why This Works

- Original commits retain their GPG/SSH signatures
- Fast-forward merge doesn't create new commits
- GitHub recognizes the commits and auto-closes the PR

### When to Use

| Scenario | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Signed commits required + squash allowed | `gh pr merge --squash` (GitHub signs) |
| Signed commits required + merge commit allowed | `gh pr merge --merge` (GitHub signs merge commit) |
| Signed commits required + rebase only | Local fast-forward merge (this solution) |

### Automation Option

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# merge-signed-pr.sh - Merge PR with signed commits via fast-forward

PR_NUMBER=$1
BRANCH=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json headRefName -q '.headRefName')

git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Verify it's a fast-forward
if ! git merge-base --is-ancestor main origin/$BRANCH; then
    echo "Error: Branch needs rebase first"
    exit 1
fi

git merge origin/$BRANCH --ff-only
git push origin main

echo "PR #$PR_NUMBER merged via fast-forward"
```

## Full PR Lifecycle Checklist

Complete end-to-end workflow for merging a PR, from CI verification through post-merge cleanup.

### 1. Verify CI Status

```bash
# Check all checks
gh pr checks <NUMBER>

# If failing, get detailed error logs
gh run view <RUN_ID> --log-failed 2>&1 | grep "There were"

# Check annotations (warnings that don't block but should be fixed)
gh api "repos/OWNER/REPO/commits/SHA/check-runs" \
  --jq '.check_runs[] | select(.output.annotations_count > 0) | {name, annotations: .output.annotations_count}'
```

### 2. Resolve Review Comments

```bash
# List unresolved threads
gh api graphql -f query='query {
  repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
    pullRequest(number: NUMBER) {
      reviewThreads(first: 30) {
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first: 1) {
            nodes { body author { login } }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved == false) | {id, author: .comments.nodes[0].author.login, comment: .comments.nodes[0].body[:100]}'

# Reply to a thread
gh api graphql -f query='mutation($body: String!, $id: ID!) {
  addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {body: $body, pullRequestReviewThreadId: $id}) {
    comment { id }
  }
}' -f body="Fixed in latest commit." -f id="PRRT_xxx"

# Resolve a thread
gh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "PRRT_xxx"}) { thread { isResolved } } }'
```

### 3. Merge

```bash
# Auto-detect merge strategy and queue
STRATEGY=$(gh api "repos/OWNER/REPO" --jq '
  if .allow_squash_merge then "--squash"
  elif .allow_merge_commit then "--merge"
  elif .allow_rebase_merge then "--rebase"
  else "--squash" end')
gh pr merge <NUMBER> --auto $STRATEGY

# For repos with merge queue, just queue it
gh pr merge <NUMBER> --auto
```

### 4. Post-Merge Cleanup

```bash
# Switch to main and pull
git checkout main && git pull

# Delete local feature branch
git branch -d <branch-name>

# Remote branch is auto-deleted if repo setting enabled, otherwise:
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```

### Common Blockers

| Blocker | Diagnosis | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| `REVIEW_REQUIRED` but no pending reviewers | Auto-approve raced with Copilot review | Re-run PR Quality Gates workflow |
| `BLOCKED` with all checks green | Unresolved review threads (even from old commits) | Resolve all threads via GraphQL |
| Auto-merge dropped after push | New commits nullify `autoMergeRequest` | Re-queue with `gh pr merge --auto` |
| CI annotations but status green | Reviewdog warnings don't block by default | Fix annotations or set `fail_level: error` |
| `startup_failure` / "no jobs ran" / config invalid | Workflow validator rejected the run before any job started | Read annotations first (see [Diagnosing CI Failures (Annotations First)](#diagnosing-ci-failures-annotations-first) above) — the literal validator error is in one line |
